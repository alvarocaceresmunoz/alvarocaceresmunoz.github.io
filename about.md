# Who am I?

I am a Computer Science and Classical Student from Pinto, Spain, born in 1994. I like making music and fiddling with computers. 

Sweet memories in my life include grabbing my mother's Turbo Pascal book, booting a Knoppix live CD in highschool, organizing a musical for a friend of mine's birthday (with a giant homemade cardboard christian cross, dark angels with neon wings, and a cake flying over the air and making the stage floor to rot after a week), making Power Point games in school, understanding Stravinsky's Rite of Spring, watching the firmament in a warm summer night at La Mata beach, and jumping over granite rocks in a natural park of Madrid's mountain range.

In the long run I would like to work in academia and research, particularly in the field of computer music.

# Education

I studied highschool at SEK-El Castillo International School while attending Programa Estrella / PEEAC (two programs for gifted children) and YPD (a young potential development program).

In 2014 I finished my highschool diploma in classical music at the Getafe Professional Conservatory of Music. In 2018 I will finish the bachelors degree in computer science and engineering at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, with a strong focus in interactive systems, games and accessibility.

# Interests and hobbies

Programming, transcribing songs and cooking are my favourite pastimes.

I listen to music all day. My favourite styles are modern jazz, twentieth-century classical music,  post-rock, progressive metal, vaporwave, afrocuban and indian music. Favourite musicians include: Steve Reich, Meshuggah, Rautavaara, Kapustin, Cynic, Exivious, Bach, Stravinsky, Balakauskas, Feldman, Ligeti, Alva Noto, Nancarrow, Prokofiev, U2, ASIWYFA, Jacob Collier, Messiaen and Bonobo (there are *many* more). 

To my mind, games can be very similar to books, provided they can tell a powerful story that leaves lots of details to the player's imagination (something which books manage to do wonderfully). Games that have had an impact on me include Golden Sun, Metroid Fusion, Kingdom Hearts II, Hotel Dusk, The Last of Us, Silent Hills, Fibrillation, JazzPunk, Memories of a Broken Dimension, Mirror Stage, Quadrilateral Cowboy, The Talos Principle, Heavy Rain, Routine, and White Night. 

I love cats. I run or walk daily, preferably in the countryside. Hiking and staring at Nature's greatness makes me feel very emotional.

In my spare time, I volunteer in free and open source projects (translating [Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net)), accessibility, and ecology (developing a web app for University of Sussex's [Team Pollin-ATE](https://www.teampollinate.co.uk) project). Kitten fostering is in my to-do list.

# Irrelevant skills

I have hypermobility in my thumbs, lucid dreams, and perfect pitch. I was once bitten by a dead shark, and I survived.
