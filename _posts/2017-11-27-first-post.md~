This is the first post of the website. There are several projects I wanted to share with people since a long time ago, and I think this is a great way of reaching people easily.

In this website I will upload
- Software projects and ideas I have
- Music (transcriptions, arrangements, original compositions)
- Information about me
- Things and experiences that I find worth sharing
- All kind of stupid content, for sure

Hope to come again with more updates soon. Until then, bye bye.
